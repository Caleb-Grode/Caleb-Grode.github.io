  <div class="col-sm-8"><p>Hi, my name is Caleb! I am an Everett Community College graduate and a second-year student at Whitworth University pursuing a B.S in Computer Science, minor in Business and M.B.A. I have enjoyed embedded engineering IoT projects using microcontroller platforms such as the Arduino or Mbed to solve practical problems. Using c++ I have learned and applied the fundamentals of computer science such as how code interacts with the memory. I will complete my Data Structures course in the fall of 2019.</p>
<p></p>
<p> I have experience as a intern at S5 solutions an engineering consultant firm based in Seattle. Working in a team of interns I helped develop a website for a homeschool coop. In a class my freshman year I worked with a partner to create a fitness tracking phone app. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Aside from my academic career I am a member of my school’s cross country and track teams. When I find the time, I enjoy reading, gaming and developing projects which address the challenges I see in every day life.
